            <p> <span style="font-size: 35px;"> John Singer Sargent </span> <span style=" font-size:21px">(January 12, 1856 – April 14, 1925)</span> was an American expatriate artist, considered the "leading portrait painter of his generation" for his evocations of Edwardian-era luxury. Widely celebrated for his masterful technique and ability to capture the elegance and opulence of his subjects, Sargent created roughly 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors. In addition to these, he produced countless sketches and charcoal drawings that documented his extensive travels around the world. His oeuvre is a testament to his relentless pursuit of artistic excellence and includes works created in diverse locations such as Venice, the Tyrol, Corfu, Capri, Spain, the Middle East, Montana, Maine, and Florida. This broad geographical range not only showcases his versatility as an artist but also his insatiable curiosity and desire to capture the essence of different cultures and landscapes.

                Born in Florence to American parents, Sargent's artistic journey began in the culturally rich environments of Europe. His parents, both expatriates, moved frequently, exposing him to a variety of artistic traditions from a young age. He received formal training in Paris, where he studied under the renowned portraitist Carolus-Duran. This period was pivotal in shaping his artistic style, particularly his bold brushwork and innovative use of color. Despite his initial success in Paris, Sargent's career took a dramatic turn following the scandal surrounding his Portrait of Madame X. Intended to solidify his reputation as a leading society painter, the portrait instead caused an uproar due to its provocative depiction of the subject. The negative reception compelled Sargent to move to London, where he continued to refine his craft and eventually found immense success.
                
                Sargent's work is characterized by remarkable technical skill, particularly in his ability to draw with a brush, which in later years inspired both admiration and criticism for its supposed superficiality. His commissioned works were consistent with the grand manner of portraiture, often portraying the elite and their lavish lifestyles with meticulous detail and sophistication. However, Sargent was not confined to portraiture alone. His informal studies and landscape paintings displayed a familiarity with Impressionism, revealing a more spontaneous and experimental side to his artistry. This duality in his work reflects his internal struggle between the demands of commissioned portraiture and his personal artistic inclinations. In later life, Sargent expressed ambivalence about the restrictions of formal portrait work and devoted much of his energy to mural painting and working en plein air. His contributions to mural painting, particularly in institutions such as the Boston Public Library and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, are notable for their ambitious scope and intricate compositions.
                
                Art historians generally ignored society artists such as Sargent until the late 20th century. It was only with the reevaluation of his oeuvre in the 1980s, particularly following the exhibition of his previously hidden male nudes, that a deeper understanding of his work emerged. These works revealed a psychological complexity that had previously been overlooked. In addition to the beauty, sensation, and innovation of his oeuvre, his same-sex interests, unconventional friendships with women, and engagement with race, gender nonconformity, and emerging globalism are now viewed as socially and aesthetically progressive and radical. This reevaluation has positioned Sargent as not only a master portraitist but also a forward-thinking artist whose work continues to resonate with contemporary audiences.</p>

        <section id="early-life">
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Sargent was a descendant of Epes Sargent, a colonial military leader and jurist. Before John Singer Sargent's birth, his father, FitzWilliam, was an eye surgeon at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia from 1844 to 1854. After John's older sister died at the age of two, his mother, Mary Newbold Sargent (née Singer), suffered a breakdown, and the couple decided to go abroad to recover. They remained nomadic expatriates for the rest of their lives. Although based in Paris, Sargent's parents moved regularly, spending seasons at the sea and at mountain resorts in France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.

                While Mary was pregnant, they stopped in Florence, Tuscany, because of a cholera epidemic. Sargent was born there in 1856. A year later, his sister Mary was born. After her birth, FitzWilliam reluctantly resigned his post in Philadelphia and accepted his wife's request to remain abroad. They lived modestly on a small inheritance and savings, leading a quiet life with their children. They generally avoided society and other Americans, except for friends in the art world. Four more children were born abroad, of whom only two lived past childhood.
                
                Although his father was a patient teacher of basic subjects, young Sargent was a rambunctious child, more interested in outdoor activities than his studies. His father wrote home: "He is quite a close observer of animated nature." His mother was convinced that traveling around Europe, and visiting museums and churches, would give young Sargent a satisfactory education. Several attempts to have him formally schooled failed, owing mostly to their itinerant life. His mother was a capable amateur artist and his father was a skilled medical illustrator. Early on, she gave him sketchbooks and encouraged drawing excursions. Sargent worked on his drawings and enthusiastically copied images from The Illustrated London News of ships and made detailed sketches of landscapes. FitzWilliam had hoped that his son's interest in ships and the sea might lead him toward a naval career.
                
                At thirteen, his mother reported that John "sketches quite nicely, & has a remarkably quick and correct eye. If we could afford to give him really good lessons, he would soon be quite a little artist". At the age of thirteen, he received some watercolor lessons from Carl Welsch, a German landscape painter. Although his education was far from complete, Sargent grew up to be a highly literate and cosmopolitan young man, accomplished in art, music, and literature. He was fluent in English, French, Italian, and German. At seventeen, Sargent was described as "willful, curious, determined and strong" (after his mother) yet shy, generous, and modest (after his father). He was well-acquainted with many of the great masters from first-hand observation, as he wrote in 1874: "I have learned in Venice to admire Tintoretto immensely and to consider him perhaps second only to Michelangelo and Titian."</p>

        <section id="training">
            <h3>Training</h3>
            <p>An attempt to study at the Academy of Florence failed, as the school was reorganizing at the time. After returning to Paris from Florence, Sargent began his art studies with the young French portraitist Carolus-Duran. Following a meteoric rise, the artist was noted for his bold technique and modern teaching methods; his influence would be pivotal to Sargent during the period from 1874 to 1878.

                In 1874, Sargent passed on his first attempt the rigorous exam required to gain admission to the École des Beaux-Arts, the premier art school in France. He took drawing classes, which included anatomy and perspective, and gained a silver prize. He also spent much time in self-study, drawing in museums and painting in a studio he shared with James Carroll Beckwith. He became both a valuable friend and Sargent's primary connection with the American artists abroad. Sargent also took some lessons from Léon Bonnat. Carolus-Duran's atelier was progressive, dispensing with the traditional academic approach, which required careful drawing and underpainting, in favor of the alla prima method of working directly on the canvas with a loaded brush, derived from Diego Velázquez. It was an approach that relied on the proper placement of tones of paint. Sargent would later create a painting in this style that prompted comments such as: "The student has surpassed the teacher."
                
                This approach also permitted spontaneous flourishes of color not bound to an underdrawing. It was markedly different from the traditional atelier of Jean-Léon Gérôme, where Americans Thomas Eakins and Julian Alden Weir had studied. Sargent was the star student in short order. Weir met Sargent in 1874 and noted that Sargent was "one of the most talented fellows I have ever come across; his drawings are like the old masters, and his color is equally fine." Sargent's excellent command of French and his superior talent made him both popular and admired. Through his friendship with Paul César Helleu, Sargent would meet giants of the art world, including Degas, Rodin, Monet, and Whistler. Sargent's early enthusiasm was for landscapes, not portraiture, as evidenced by his voluminous sketches full of mountains, seascapes, and buildings. Carolus-Duran's expertise in portraiture finally influenced Sargent in that direction. Commissions for history paintings were still considered more prestigious, but were much harder to get. Portrait painting, on the other hand, was the best way of promoting an art career, getting exhibited in the Salon, and gaining commissions to earn a livelihood. Sargent's first major portrait was of his friend Fanny Watts in 1877, and was also his first Salon admission. Its particularly well-executed pose drew attention. His second salon entry was the Oyster Gatherers of Cançale, an impressionistic painting of which he made two copies, one of which he sent back to the United States, and both received warm reviews.</p>

        <section id="works">
            <h3>Works</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="keywords"> Portrait of Madame X </span> <br> <br> His most controversial work, <a class="links" href="../paintings/HTML/madame-x.html" target="_blank"> Portrait of Madame X (Madame Pierre Gautreau) (1884)</a> is now considered one of his best works and was his favorite. When unveiled in Paris at the 1884 Salon, it aroused such a negative reaction that it likely prompted Sargent's move to London. His self-confidence led him to attempt a risqué experiment in portraiture—but this time it unexpectedly backfired.

                The painting was not commissioned by her, and he pursued her for the opportunity, quite unlike most of his portrait work where clients sought him out. Sargent wrote to a common acquaintance: "I have a great desire to paint her portrait and have reason to think she would allow it and is waiting for someone to propose this homage to her beauty. ...you might tell her that I am a man of prodigious talent."

                It took well over a year to complete the painting. The first version of the portrait of Madame Gautreau, with the famously plunging neckline, white-powdered skin, and arrogantly cocked head, featured an intentionally suggestive off-the-shoulder dress strap, on her right side only, which made the overall effect more daring and sensual. Sargent repainted the strap to its expected over-the-shoulder position to try to dampen the furor, but the damage had been done. French commissions dried up and he contemplated giving up painting for music or business.

                Judith Gautier observed: "Is it a woman? a chimera, the figure of a unicorn rearing as on a heraldic coat of arms or perhaps the work of some oriental decorative artist to whom the human form is forbidden and who, wishing to be reminded of woman, has drawn the delicious arabesque? No, it is none of these things, but rather the precise image of a modern woman scrupulously drawn by a painter who is a master of his art."

                Prior to the Madame X scandal of 1884, Sargent had painted exotic beauties such as Rosina Ferrara of Capri and the Spanish expatriate model Carmela Bertagna. Sargent kept the painting prominently displayed in his London studio until he sold it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1916 after moving to the United States.

                <br><br><span class="keywords">Move to England</span> <br><br> Before arriving in England, Sargent began sending paintings for exhibition at the Royal Academy. These included the portraits of <a class="links" href="../paintings/HTML/dr-pozzi-at-home.html" target="_blank"> Dr. Pozzi at Home (1881)</a>, a flamboyant essay in red and his first full-length male portrait, and the more traditional Mrs. Henry White (1883). The ensuing portrait commissions encouraged Sargent to complete his move to London in 1886, where he settled in the artistic community of Chelsea.

                Notwithstanding the Madame X scandal, he had considered moving to London as early as 1882; he had been urged to do so repeatedly by his new friend, the novelist Henry James. English critics were not warm at first, faulting Sargent for his "clever" "Frenchified" handling of paint. One reviewer described his technique as "hard" and "almost metallic" with "no taste in expression, air, or modeling". With help from Mrs. White, however, Sargent soon gained the admiration of English patrons and critics. Henry James also gave the artist "a push to the best of my ability".

                Sargent spent much time painting outdoors in the English countryside when not in his studio. On a visit to Monet at Giverny in 1885, Sargent painted one of his most Impressionistic portraits, of Monet at work painting outdoors with his new bride nearby. Sargent is usually not thought of as an Impressionist painter, but he sometimes used impressionistic techniques to great effect. His Claude Monet Painting at the Edge of a Wood is rendered in his own version of the Impressionist style. Sargent purchased four Monet works for his personal collection during that time.

                Sargent was similarly inspired to do a portrait of his artist friend Paul César Helleu, also painting outdoors with his wife by his side. Through Helleu, Sargent met and painted the famed French sculptor Auguste Rodin in 1884. Although the British critics classified Sargent in the Impressionist camp, the French Impressionists thought otherwise. As Monet later stated: "He is not an Impressionist in the sense that we use the word, he is too much under the influence of Carolus-Duran."

                Sargent's first major success at the Royal Academy of Arts came in 1887, with the enthusiastic response to <a class="links" href="../paintings/HTML/carnation,-lily,-lily,-rose.html" target="_blank">Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose</a>, a large piece, painted on-site, of two young girls lighting lanterns in an English garden in Broadway in the Cotswolds. The painting was immediately purchased by the Tate Gallery.

                His first trip to New York and Boston as a professional artist in 1887–88 produced over 20 important commissions, including portraits of Isabella Stewart Gardner, the famed Boston art patron. In Boston, Sargent was honored with his first solo exhibition, which presented 22 of his paintings. Here he became friends with painter Dennis Miller Bunker, who traveled to England in the summer of 1888 to paint with him en plein air and is the subject of Sargent's 1888 painting Dennis Miller Bunker Painting at Calcot.

                Back in London, Sargent was quickly busy again. His working methods were by then well-established. After securing a commission, Sargent would visit the client's home to see where the painting was to hang. He would often review a client's wardrobe to pick suitable attire. Some portraits were done in the client's home, but more often in his studio. He usually required eight to ten sittings from his clients, although he would try to capture the face in one sitting. He usually kept up pleasant conversation and sometimes took a break and played the piano for his sitter. Sargent seldom used pencil or oil sketches, and instead laid down oil paint directly.

                Sargent had no assistants; he handled all tasks, such as preparing his canvases, varnishing the painting, arranging for photography, shipping, and documentation. He commanded about $5,000 per portrait. Some American clients traveled to London at their own expense to have Sargent paint their portrait. The range of pigments regularly used by Sargent included Mars yellow, cadmium yellow, viridian, emerald green, vermillion, Mars red, madder, synthetic ultramarine, cobalt blue, ivory black, sienna, and Mars brown.

                Around 1890, Sargent painted two daring non-commissioned portraits as show pieces—one of actress <a class="links" href="../paintings/HTML/ellen-terry-as-lady-macbeth.html" target="_blank">Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth</a> and one of the popular Spanish dancer <a class="links" href="../paintings/HTML/la-carmencita.html" target="_blank"> La Carmencita</a>. Sargent was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, and was made a full member three years later.In the 1890s, Sargent averaged fourteen portrait commissions per year, none more beautiful than the genteel <a class="links" href="../paintings/HTML/portrait-of-lady-agnew-of-lochnaw.html" target="_blank">Lady Agnew of Lochnaw (1892)</a>. His portrait of Mrs. Hugh Hammersley (1892) was equally well received for its lively depiction of one of London's most notable hostesses. As a portrait painter in the grand manner, Sargent had unmatched success; he portrayed subjects who were at once ennobled and often possessed of nervous energy. Sargent was referred to as "the Van Dyck of our times."

                Although Sargent was an American expatriate, he returned to the United States many times, often to answer the demand for commissioned portraits. He exhibited nine of his portraits in the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

                Sargent painted a series of three portraits of Robert Louis Stevenson. The second, Portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson and his Wife (1885), was one of his best known. He also completed portraits of two U.S. presidents: Theodore Roosevelt and <a class="links" href="../paintings/HTML/portrait-of-woodrow-wilson.html" target="_blank"> Woodrow Wilson</a>. In 1896, the Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art commissioned Sargent to produce a portrait of Henry Gurdon Marquand. Marquand served as the second president of the museum and was instrumental in its founding. Many of his most important works are in museums in the United States. In 1897, a friend sponsored a famous portrait in oil of Mr. and Mrs. I. N. Phelps Stokes, by Sargent, as a wedding gift.

                In 1898, Asher Wertheimer, a wealthy Jewish art dealer living in London, commissioned from Sargent a series of a dozen portraits of his family, the artist's largest commission from a single patron. The Wertheimer portraits reveal a pleasant familiarity between the artist and his subjects. Even though Wertheimer bequeathed most of the paintings to the National Gallery, nowadays they are on display at the Tate Britain.

                <br><br><span class="keywords">Twentieth-century portraits</span><br><br>

                By 1900, Sargent was at the height of his fame. Cartoonist Max Beerbohm completed one of his seventeen caricatures of Sargent, making well known to the public the artist's paunchy physique. Although only in his forties, Sargent began to travel more and devote relatively less time to portrait painting. His An Interior in Venice (1900), a portrait of four members of the Curtis family in their elegant palatial home, Palazzo Barbaro, was a resounding success. But Whistler did not approve of the looseness of Sargent's brushwork, which he summed up as "smudge everywhere." One of Sargent's last major portraits in his bravura style was that of Lord Ribblesdale (1902), finely attired in an elegant hunting uniform. Between 1900 and 1907, Sargent continued his high productivity, which included, in addition to dozens of oil portraits, hundreds of portrait drawings at about $400 each. In 1901, he purchased the next-door property to his home in Tite Street to create a larger studio.

                In 1907, at the age of fifty-one, Sargent officially closed his studio. Relieved, he stated: "Painting a portrait would be quite amusing if one were not forced to talk while working.... What a nuisance having to entertain the sitter and to look happy when one feels wretched." In that same year, Sargent painted his modest and serious self-portrait, his last, for the celebrated self-portrait collection of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.

                Sargent made several summer visits to the Swiss Alps with his sisters Emily Sargent, an accomplished painter in her own right, and Violet Sargent (Mrs. Ormond) and also Violet's daughters Rose-Marie and Reine, who were the subject of a number of paintings between 1906 and 1913, like The Black Brook (1908) and Nonchaloir (Repose) (1911).

                By the time Sargent finished his portrait of John D. Rockefeller in 1917, most critics began to consign him to the masters of the past, "a brilliant ambassador between his patrons and posterity." Modernists treated him more harshly, considering him completely out of touch with the reality of American life and with emerging artistic trends including Cubism and Futurism. Sargent quietly accepted the criticism but refused to alter his negative opinions of modern art. He retorted: "Ingres, Raphael and El Greco, these are now my admirations, these are what I like."

                Sometime between 1917 and 1920, Sargent painted the portrait of Thomas E. McKeller, a young African-American elevator operator and WWI veteran. The canvas was kept in the painter's studio until his death and only began to be displayed permanently to the public in 1986 when it was acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. McKeller also posed as a model for the mythological murals that Sargent painted at the stairway and the rotunda of the MFA Boston and for the World War I memorial murals at Harvard's Widener Library.

                In 1925, shortly before he died, Sargent painted his last oil portrait, a canvas of aristocrat Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston. The painting was purchased in 1936 by the Currier Museum of Art in Manchester, New Hampshire, where it has been on display since then.

                <br><br><span class="keywords">Watercolors</span><br><br>

                During Sargent's long career, he painted more than 2,000 <a class="links" href="../pages/watercolor_paintings.html" target="_blank"> watercolors</a>, roving from the English countryside to Venice, the Tyrol, Corfu, the Middle East, Montana, Maine, and Florida. Each destination offered pictorial stimulation and treasure. Even at his leisure, in escaping the pressures of the portrait studio, he painted with restless intensity, often painting from morning until night.

                His hundreds of watercolors of Venice are especially notable, many done from the perspective of a gondola. His colors were sometimes extremely vivid and as one reviewer noted: "Everything is given with the intensity of a dream." In the Middle East and North Africa, Sargent painted Bedouins, goatherds, and fishermen. In the last decade of his life, he produced many watercolors in Maine, Florida, and the American West, of fauna, flora, and native peoples.

                With his watercolors, Sargent was able to indulge his earliest artistic inclinations for nature, architecture, exotic peoples, and noble mountain landscapes. And it is in some of his late works where one senses Sargent painting most purely for himself. His watercolors were executed with a joyful fluidness. He also painted extensively family, friends, gardens, and fountains. In watercolors, he playfully portrayed his friends and family dressed in Orientalist costume, relaxing in brightly lit landscapes that allowed for a more vivid palette and experimental handling than did his commissions (The Chess Game, 1906). His first major solo exhibit of watercolor works was at the Carfax Gallery in London in 1905. In 1909, he exhibited eighty-six watercolors in New York City, eighty-three of which were bought by the Brooklyn Museum.

                Evan Charteris wrote in 1927: "To live with Sargent's water-colours is to live with sunshine captured and held, with the luster of a bright and legible world, 'the refluent shade' and 'the Ambient ardours of the noon'."

                Although not generally accorded the critical respect given Winslow Homer, perhaps America's greatest watercolorist, scholarship has revealed that Sargent was fluent in the entire range of opaque and transparent watercolor technique, including the methods used by Homer.

                <br><br><span class="keywords">Other works</span><br><br>


                As a concession to the insatiable demand of wealthy patrons for portraits, Sargent dashed off hundreds of rapid <a class="links" href="../pages/drawings.html" target="_blank"> charcoal portrait sketches</a>, which he called "Mugs". Forty-six of these, spanning the years 1890–1916, were exhibited at the Royal Society of Portrait Painters in 1916.

                All of Sargent's murals are to be found in the Boston/Cambridge area in Massachusetts. They are in the Boston Public Library, the Museum of Fine Arts, and Harvard's Widener Library. Sargent's largest scale works are the mural decorations Triumph of Religion that grace the Boston Public Library, depicting the history of religion and the gods of polytheism. They were attached to the walls of the library by means of marouflage. He worked on the cycle for almost thirty years but never completed the final mural. Sargent drew on his extensive travels and museum visits to create a dense art historical mélange. The murals were most recently restored in 2003–2004 by a team from the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies, Harvard Art Museums.

                Sargent worked on the murals from 1895 through 1919; they were intended to show religion's (and society's) progress from pagan superstition up through the ascension of Christianity, concluding with a painting depicting Jesus delivering the Sermon on the Mount. But Sargent's paintings of "The Church" and "The Synagogue", installed in late 1919, inspired a debate about whether the artist had represented Judaism in a stereotypical, or even an anti-Semitic, manner. Drawing upon iconography that was used in medieval paintings, Sargent portrayed Judaism and the synagogue as a blind, ugly hag, and Christianity and the church as a lovely, radiant young woman. He also failed to understand how these representations might be problematic for the Jews of Boston; he was both surprised and hurt when the paintings were criticized. The paintings were objectionable to Boston Jews since they seemed to show Judaism defeated, and Christianity triumphant. The Boston newspapers also followed the controversy, noting that while many found the paintings offensive, not everyone agreed. In the end, Sargent abandoned his plan to finish the murals, and the controversy eventually died down.

                Upon his return to England in 1918 after a visit to the United States,Sargent was commissioned as a war artist by the British Ministry of Information. In his large painting Gassed and in many watercolors, he depicted scenes from the Great War. Sargent had been affected by the death of his niece Rose-Marie in the shelling of the St Gervais church, Paris, on Good Friday 1918.

            <p>In 1922, Sargent co-founded New York City's Grand Central Art Galleries together with Edmund Greacen, Walter Leighton Clark, and others. Sargent actively participated in the Grand Central Art Galleries and their academy, the Grand Central School of Art, until his death in 1925. The Galleries held a major retrospective exhibit of Sargent's work in 1924. He then returned to England, where he died at his Chelsea home on April 14, 1925, of heart disease. Sargent is interred in Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey.

                Memorial exhibitions of Sargent's work were held in Boston in 1925, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and at the Royal Academy and Tate Gallery in London in 1926. The Grand Central Art Galleries also organized a posthumous exhibition in 1928 of previously unseen sketches and drawings from throughout his career.</p>
