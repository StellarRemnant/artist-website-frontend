# Artist Portfolio Front-End

A visually stunning front-end website to explore an artist’s paintings and biography.

## Overview

The website offers an intuitive and interactive experience to browse paintings through multiple features:

- **Search Bar:**  
  On the main page and each gallery page, users can type the name of a painting into a search bar that dynamically suggests matching titles. Selecting a suggestion navigates directly to that painting’s detail page.

- **Slideshow:**  
  A beautiful slideshow on the main page showcases selected paintings. It supports two modes:  
  - *Automatic:* slides change on their own  
  - *Manual:* users can navigate using keyboard arrows or clickable next/previous buttons

- **3D Carousel:**  
  A visually appealing 3D carousel displays three images representing different painting categories: Oil Paintings, Watercolors, and Drawings. Each image acts as a link to its respective gallery page.

- **Gallery Pages:**  
  Each category page presents a grid gallery of paintings. Users can click any painting to open its detailed page. The search bar on these pages functions identically to the main page’s.

- **Painting Detail Pages:**  
  Each painting’s page includes:  
  - A detailed view of the painting with zoom-in functionality for close inspection  
  - A hidden navigation bar accessible via a hamburger menu  
  - Painting-specific details

- **Biography Page:**  
  Clicking the artist’s name on the main page takes users to a dedicated biography page.
